Ran a #shutdownGA campaign. Started [petition](https://www.change.org/p/tell-governor-kemp-shut-down-georgia-today-save-lives-shutdownga) that garnered [80k+ signatures](/pdfs/shutdown_petition_signatures_28Mar.pdf) in 2 weeks, sent those the governor and federal reps. Also made GA-specific graphs and wrote [emails](/pdfs/shutdown_email.pdf) to dozens of state legislators mayors, and created [website](https://sites.google.com/view/shutdownga/) to coordinate efforts.
