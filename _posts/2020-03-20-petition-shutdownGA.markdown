I created a petition to shut down my home state (Georgia) and got [80k+ signatures](/pdfs/shutdown_petition_signatures_28Mar.pdf) in 2 weeks. I sent it to my governor and federal representatives. I also did GA-specific hospital capacity [analysis](/pdfs/shutdown_email.pdf) and emailed it to over >200 state legislators and city mayors. I made a [website](https://sites.google.com/view/shutdownga/) to coordinate volunteers.
