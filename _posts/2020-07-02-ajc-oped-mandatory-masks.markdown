Wrote op-ed about mandating masks in my home state, Georgia, calling wearing masks patriotic. Written in mid-May, the article was published in the Atlanta Journal Constitution when rising cases caused dozens of states (including Texas) to mandate masks. (In contrast, two weeks later, Georgia Governor Kemp sued Atlanta Mayor Bottoms for having a city-wide mask mandate).
