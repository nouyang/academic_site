Work on a novel [Gelsight](http://people.csail.mit.edu/kimo/gelsight/) design
customized to a specific application. Gelsights are visual-tactile sensors used
to give robots a sense of touch. The Digger Finger is a miniaturezed,
custom-shaped sensor specialized for digging in sand and other granular media,
which has rarely been explored with robotic touch before. I helped prototype the
physical design as well as the initial shape detection and annotation algorithm which used
a [YOLO-OBB](https://github.com/heshameraqi/yolo-obb-roadway-features-OLD/) model.
