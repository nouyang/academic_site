Work on a novel [Gelsight](http://people.csail.mit.edu/kimo/gelsight/) design customized to a specific application. I manually labelled images from the novel application, then trained a [YOLO-OBB](https://github.com/heshameraqi/yolo-obb-roadway-features-OLD/) model and analyzed extrapolation to similar situations, as well as failure cases. Submitted to the [International Symposium on Experimental Robotics (ISER)](http://iser2020.org/) 2020.
