Using a flywheel to invert a pendulum. In simulation, we derive the equations of motion and apply LQR and region of attraction analyses for our system.
We also build a hardware system from scratch and implement swingup and stabilization using PD and bang-bang control. I did the analysis and controls and co-built the hardware system.
