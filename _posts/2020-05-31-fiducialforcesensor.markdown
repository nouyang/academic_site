A novel six-axis force/torque sensor. The sensor is low-cost (<$50) compared to
other sensors which can cost up to tens of thousands of dollars (e.g. some ATI
sensors). The sensing component itself uses simple webcam and a printed paper tag, 
allowing for ease-of-use (just plug in the USB). The sensor is also quite
small. Design files and code are open-source (see website).
